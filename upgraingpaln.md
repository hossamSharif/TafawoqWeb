⦁	and the premuim plan (10 exam and 15 practices ) ,  the reward  also when he share an exam he will get 1 exam as reward , same for practices , he can share only 10 exam and 15 practices )  premuim users also can access libabry and do the exam and pracices on it and it will appear in thier exam history but he cant share it for others'
